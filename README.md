# Li Feng's Personal Website (Throwaway)

I've been wanting to build a personal website since 2020. Apparently it's 2023 now, and guess what? No personal website. So I will attempt to make a personal website, complete with a portfolio and everything, within a few days.

If you are still reading this, I probably abandoned the project already (very sad).

## Development
This website uses [Astro](https://astro.build), a blazing fast meta-framework and static site generator. Read the [Astro docs](https://docs.astro.build/en/getting-started/) on how to use and edit Astro files.

### Installation
Make sure a recent version of Node.js and NPM is installed.

`npm install` for installing required packages.
`npm run dev` for running the dev server.

### Contributing
Suggestions and pull requests are welcomed, and feel free to open discussions or issues for bug/style fixes or potential pull requests! However, please wait until after the development period (which is right now).
